    "feature1_desc": "VanityForge utilizes a stateless architecture. Private keys are generated in volatile RAM within secure, isolated containers. Once the vanity address is found, it is immediately encrypted. The raw private key <span class=\"text-white font-bold\">never touches a hard drive or database</span> in its unencrypted form.",

    "feature2_desc": "Before your key leaves the generation container, it is encrypted using <span class=\"font-mono text-xs bg-black/30 p-1 rounded\">Fernet (AES-128-CBC)</span> with a key derived from your <span class=\"text-white font-bold\">Personal Vault PIN</span> using <span class=\"font-mono text-xs bg-black/30 p-1 rounded\">PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256</span> (100,000 iterations). We do not store your PIN. Without it, the stored encrypted blob is mathematically impossible to decrypt.",

    "feature3_desc": "Our codebase is open source. The entire generation pipeline, from the Numpad UI to the Rust-based GPU grinder, is verifiable on GitHub. You verify the code, you trust the math."
